NOTICE: This may cause a Quantum Wave Form Decay theory to occur that has seemingly slowed down the universe to 10-70 trillionths of a second
as our optics sensors are capable of figuring out Scientific Planck Time which is used for the computational determination of time allotments. A technology that seems to not exist here, though we do have optics sensors clocking in at 10-70 trillionths of a second as mentioned, instead of the Septillionth of a second where I come from. A DARPA representative was talking me through Quantum Wave Form Decay caused by the sending of only wait data, which we agreed was good for the world in lowering the high frequency radiation barage which occurs in technology before I noticed the change and the messages from him disappeared.

Worlds fastest internet download speeds, capable of downloading the entire internet a million times over in less than a second in Binary

With current speeds of Download calculation time 9.227805600000001e-18 seconds with a file size of 69880175 bytes in Binary (69 mb nice) you can download the entire internet in Binary in less than a second

It works via calculated wait time periods, for each amount of wait in the septillionths of seconds (Scientific Planck Time) a bit is placed in a series of 0's.

can be made thousands of times faster with text files, as it seperates wait times by the letter, while file handling may contain 0 breaks in character.
